# Pure Go Filecoin signer


> A pure Go (CGO free) signing library for Filecoin

Supports both Secp256k1 and BLS signatures.

An important goal of this library is avoiding CGO dependencies which is very convenient
for simplicity and painless compatibility in multiples OS and CPU architectures.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Provide a Wallet interface that can be a drop-in replacement with Lotus wallets.
- [ ] Include more test vectors for both secp256k1 and BLS signatures.
